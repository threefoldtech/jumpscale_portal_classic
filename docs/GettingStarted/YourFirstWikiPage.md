## Your First Wiki Page

TODO: improve

Now that you have your app up and running it's time to put some content in it.

You can easily add some wiki content:

-   Goto `portal/main/base/myspacename`.
-   Create a folder `.space` and add a file `default.wiki`
    -   This is the template of your app
-   Now you can create `Home.wiki` which will act as index of this space
-   Minimal space content:
    -   /myspace/.space
    -   /myspace/Home.wiki
-   Option space content:
    -   /myspace/.files (Used to store static files)
    -   /myspace/.macros (Used to store space specific macros)
