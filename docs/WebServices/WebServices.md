## Web Services

Rest Services are provided under `[ip]/rest` and `[ip]/restmachine` 

These allow actor methods to be exposed over rest.

For human usage, [Rest Services](RestWebServices.md) are convenient and simple to use, giving a string representation of the output of the rest call.

For machines, [REST Machine Services](RestMachineServices.md) give a machine-readable output.
